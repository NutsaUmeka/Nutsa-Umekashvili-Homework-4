      Rock is a broad genre of popular music that originated in the United
      States, but also in United Kingdom, in the late 1950s and early 1960s,
      developing a lot of subgenres, including heavy metal and punk rock. It has
      its roots in 1940s and 1950s rock and roll, a style that drew directly
      from the genres of blues, rhythm and blues, and from country music.

      Rock musicians in the mid-1960s began to advance the album ahead of the
      single as the dominant form of recorded music expression and consumption,
      with the Beatles at the forefront of this development. Their contributions
      lent the genre a cultural legitimacy in the mainstream and initiated a
      rock-informed album era in the music industry for the next several
      decades. By the late 1960s "classic rock"[3] period, a few distinct rock
      music subgenres had emerged, including hybrids like blues rock, folk rock,
      country rock, Southern rock, raga rock, and jazz rock, which contributed
      to the development of psychedelic rock, influenced by the countercultural
      psychedelic and hippie scene.

        Post-punk (originally called new musick)[2] is a broad genre of music
        that emerged in 1977 in the wake of punk rock. Post-punk musicians
        departed from punk's fundamental elements and raw simplicity, instead
        adopting a broader, more experimental approach that encompassed a
        variety of avant-garde sensibilities and non-rock influences. Inspired
        by punk's energy and do it yourself ethic but determined to break from
        rock cliches, artists experimented with styles like funk, electronic
        music, jazz, and dance music; the production techniques of dub and
        disco; and ideas from art and politics, including critical theory,
        modernist art, cinema and literature.[3][4] These communities produced
        independent record labels, visual art, multimedia performances and
        fanzines.
